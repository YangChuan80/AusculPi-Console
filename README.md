## Introduction
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, more and more physicians and nurses have been participating the battle to coronavirus at the first line treatment. Almost all patients in critical status were having pneumonia, respiratory failure and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome. So, auscultation was important for those patients to achieve accurate diagnosis, assessment of current severity and treatment efficacy. However, inside quarantine ward in hospitals, medical staff who were wearing protective clothing were unable to use conventional stethoscopes due to the head protective suit covering the regions of their ears. Auscultation examination was essential but hard to accomplished especially to the patients with poor respiratory conditions, such as severe pneumonia, respiratory dysfunction, intensive cases who were intubated and assisted with ventilators. Some experts have viewpoint suggesting less stethoscope and more ultrasound, while other experts stress the necessity of stethoscope and auscultation in COVID-19 treatment. 

To challenge this paradox circumstance, we developed an electronic stethoscope using a credit card sized single-board computer (SBC), Raspberry Pi, connected to a chest piece of a conventional stethoscope and a tiny speaker, which can be easily modified by medical staff themselves. The software run by raspberry pi coded in python programming language was open source and has already been published on GitHub repository. All users who are interest in the stethoscope all around the world can assemble the components easily and download the software freely in a do-it-yourself (DIY) way.

The graphic user interface (GUI) of the touch screen displayed by Auscul Pi. A. The desktop display after startup. The users can double touch the Auscul Pi icon to run the program. The recorded data will be stored in the folder AudioData. B. The manipulation interface of Auscul Pi Console after double touch the Auscul Pi Console icon. You can control the auscultation and replay by touching the “Auscultate” and “Replay” buttons with your fingertip.

## Prerequisites
### Install the Audio (Essential!!!)
This option is only adopted by Python specialist. There are several dependencies necessarily preinstalled in your Python interpreter:

- **PyAudio**
```
$ sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
 ```
Else if you are running python 2.7
```
$ sudo apt install python-pyaudio 
```

- Config the audio settings of Raspberry Pi
Type the following command:
```
$ sudo raspi-config
```
Select "Advanced Options", then select "Audio", press Enter. After that select "Finish".

### Test and Regulate the audio settings

- Check the hardware of record and play configuration:
The record function:
```
$ arecord -l
```
The play function:
```
$ aplay -l
```
Find the card # and device #
For instance, the record is card 1 and device 0, and play is card 0 and device 0:

- Adjust the volume:

Use this command to adjust volume of microphone and speaker
```
$ alsamixer
```
Press F4 or F6 to select the volume

- Test the audio:

Speaker:
 ```
$ speaker-test –t wav
```
Microphone:
```
$ arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=5 --rate=16000 --file-type=raw sample.wav
aplay --format=S16_LE --rate=16000 sample.wav
```
### Touch screen installation
- Change HDMI to Touch Screen:
Copy and paste the following lines to terminal:
```
sudo rm -rf LCD-show 

git clone https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show.git 

chmod -R 755 LCD-show 

cd LCD-show/

sudo ./LCD35-show
```
- Back to HDMI display mode:
If you want to change Touch Screen back to HDMI display model, paste the following:
```
chmod -R 755 LCD-show 

cd LCD-show/ 

sudo ./LCD-hdmi
```

### PyInstaller
For the GUI application, we'd better use mouse-click to open the application. Run this:
```
pip3 install pyinstaller
```

### Launch the application from desktop
Create a new file called *AusculPiConsole.desktop*. Attention, the extesion of the file is .desktop! The content is as below:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Auscul Pi Console
Comment= Application for LCECS
Icon=
Exec=/home/pi/Documents/Code/AusculPi/AusculPiConsole/AusculPiConsole
Type=Application
Encoding=UTF-8
Terminal=false
```
